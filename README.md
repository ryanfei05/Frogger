# Frogger

## Description
This is a simple Frogger clone based on the original popular Frogger Game. Built using Java through Java Swing to create GUI Game. Originally made for my ICS 4U1 Final Summative in school. Showcases an understanding and proficiency in OOP and Game Design, including movement, collisions, and increasing difficulty & lives.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Run the 'Main.java' file and a game window should appear

## How to Play (Simple WASD controls)
1. Move (WASD) to avoid cars and reach the river
2. Jump onto moving logs to make it across the river
3. If you get hit by a car of fall into the river, you lose a life (3 Total)
4. If you make it across to the end, you get a Win, restarting with faster cars & logs
